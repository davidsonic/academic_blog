      <description>Our demo in exhibition for USC Robotics Open House. My colleagues and I presented &amp;ldquo;Robust Grasping via Human Adversarial&amp;rdquo; to visitors and explained the motivation behind the algorithm. Our demo is implemented in customized simulation environment based on physics engine mujoco and supports real-time human interactions.
During the day, we give users the opportunity to apply perturbations to objects via keyboards and mouse, and we show that the manipulator&amp;rsquo;s grasping skill as well as robustness increases over time.</description>
